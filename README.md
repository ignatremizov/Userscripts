## Ignat's scripts

A collection of scripts I wrote for various tasks

- `firefox-disable-private-window-shortcut/README.md`: Disable Shift+Cmd+P in Firefox (macOS) so web apps can use it. Use `cd firefox-disable-private-window-shortcut && make install` or `cd firefox-disable-private-window-shortcut && make uninstall`.
